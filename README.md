# Ploopy-Knob-80
A bottom-case mod for the Ploopy Knob so that it can mount on a Glove80 keyboard. Current file is for the left half of the Glove80 only. Model is based on the original files from both Ploopy (https://github.com/ploopyco/knob) and Glove80 (https://www.moergo.com/pages/glove80-ergonomic-keyboard-customization?srsltid=AfmBOooGfX56Mnf0L8u05VyCDyuUStRs71EcAYHDeNLZX2QJ-hW2fVRI#:~:text=the%20controller%20PCB.-,Sidecar,-The%20underside%20of).

Unlike the original Ploopy files, this is just the bottom half of the Knob. The Ploopy repository has the full 3D files.

The following printing instructions were provided by Ploopy (https://ploopyco.github.io/knob/appendices/3d-printing/) for the Knob files and have worked for me. I have not tested any other settings:

Printing your own parts
So, you have a printer and want to print your own parts? Great! We don't have specific instructions, since every printer setup is different. All of the STLs are available, and if you need to make tweaks, you can alter the design files.

Here are the settings we use when we print parts. Note that these settings have only been tested on the Prusa i3 MK2.5S and MK3S. If you have another printer, you may need to tweak these settings.

PLA. The geometry of many of the parts is quite complex; trying to use other materials may not result in success.
0.30mm layer height. You can go finer than this if you want, but we haven't tested that. Going coarser is not going to work; first, it's going to feel rough on your hand, and second, it won't accurately capture the necessary detail.
No support material is necessary. If your slicer is showing support material, you didn't orient the parts correctly.
Orient the pieces so that flat sides are on the build plate.
We like gyroid for infill pattern, but anything is probably good. Cubic, rectilinear, whatever.
We use 0.4mm nozzles. We haven't tested other nozzle sizes.
